This repository explores multiple data structure and algorithm problems using Python programming


### Problem Solving Strategy

- Clear problem statement; identify input and output formats
- Understand or generate example inputs and outputs.
- Try to cover edge cases. Create scenarios of possible inputs and outputs
- Come up with a solution in plain language
- Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. 
- Understand and fix bugs, if any.
- Analyze the algorithm's complexity and identify optimization areas
- Overcome inefficiencies. 
- Reiterate the above steps
